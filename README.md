# economyManager
A Unity framework to make an economy management game

The game is a 2D narrative focused base/staff/resource management sim set in a space station. The Player creates their character and the game begins as you set up your transport company in the space station. You make money and progress by filling out transport orders and devliveries, using the ships you buy and the pilots you hire. This process is mainly menu and text driven, like the away missions in Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker and Metal Gear Solid 5: The Phantom Pain but instead of sending out a team of mercenaries, you send your ships out and they come back with a report of what went down, like how much money they made, if they ran into any trouble, damage taken and repairs needed, experience points earned, etc...
The game follows an internal clock, a day to day cycle that turn into seasons and eventually years.

There are eventually other ways to make money too, like resource collecting, gambling and other stuff but this is the main one, and the one that moves the main story forward.
